I got it; now I want to help expand the information, payloads and more. I have experience in plenty of different programming languages including Swift (By Apple Inc.). \r\n\r\n### Cases\r\nI am going to be making and selling rubber ducky cases, I will also except costume orders such as steel, engravings or things like that. Also I would like people to vote on an appropriate price for the cases, and don't think of labor to much, I love machining and it will be ran on CNC. I'm not to sure on the topic of anodization though, but I will look into it\r\n\r\n### Payloads\r\nAny of the payloads I make will most likely end up in Hak5's Github wiki unless of course it's already there. I make payloads that are pretty simple. Im still new to the DuckyScript and the Ducky itself but I will keep working.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
