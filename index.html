<p>I was watching Hak5 and I seen it on there, I just had to have it. I got it; now I want to help expand the information, payloads and more. I have experience in plenty of different programming languages including Swift (By Apple Inc.). </p>

<h3>
<a id="cases" class="anchor" href="#cases" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cases</h3>

<p>I am going to be making and selling rubber ducky cases, I will also except costume orders such as steel, engravings or things like that. Also I would like people to vote on an appropriate price for the cases, and don't think of labor to much, I love machining and it will be ran on CNC. I'm not to sure on the topic of anodization though, but I will look into it</p>

<h3>
<a id="payloads" class="anchor" href="#payloads" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Payloads</h3>

<p>Any of the payloads I make will most likely end up in Hak5's Github wiki unless of course it's already there. I make payloads that are pretty simple. Im still new to the DuckyScript and the Ducky itself but I will keep working.</p>
